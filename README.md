# Audio Playground

A little area to play with sound processing, OpenAL, and such

Executables can be found under tests, should be fairly self explanatory

# Building
Should be a fairly straightfoward CMake build. Repo uses submodules under extern/ so fetch those before building.

The following dependencies are needed:
* OpenGL
* OpenAL
* glm
* glfw3
* GLEW (When building on Windows)

# Licence
* Unless specified otherwise in folder/file everything is covered by the BSD licence
* extern/dr_libs: Public domain
* extern/kissfft: BSD/Unilicence
* shadertoy/shaders: Shaders taken from shadertoy.com, mostly creative commons, or BSD. See header of files.
* music: Various licences, see Readme.md in each folder

Many thanks to the authors of these dependencies, just let me know if there's any usage issues.
