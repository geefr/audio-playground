So this is some audio playground/thing, so far a basic test of playing a wav through OpenAL

Ideas:
- Spatial music visualiser
- Spatialised video chat app? - video chat part is probably super complex
- Virtual conference room ala vrchat? - Ew..networking..
- Basic game with spatial audio
- Ambience generator
  - Some file format for various loops
  - Random noises
  - Lots of voice samples/mumbling to make a background din
  - Server room/computer noises
  - Essentially 'maps' for room audio, made up of a bunch of different samples all over the place
- Spatialised midi player (Surely that already exists though, and kinda lame)
- Graphical thing, visualiser maybe
  -> Maybe a music player with shadertoy integration (Does this exist anywhere else?)
