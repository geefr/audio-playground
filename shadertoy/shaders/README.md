# Shader Toy Shaders

This collection of shaders comes from various sources, mainly from shadertoy.com

Most contain their licences, if anything's wrong there just let me know.

# Format
* Shaders must be in .frag files
* No subdirectories allowed for now
* Shaders must have a mainImage function
* Shaders must follow the shadertoy spec otherwise
* Shaders must be valid for OpenGL 3.3
* Shaders should use the audio input on iChannel0 - For now this is hardcoded and no other input channels are available
